My data set is a national household education survey. More specifically the data I chose is about where the students who completed the survey were cared for. This is either in their own home, other home, or both. I was interested to see how many children lived at home and how that might have affected their education at a young age. I wanted to see the in the amount of kids who lived in different places. I was interested to see where they would live if they didn't live at home. This frequency chart has showed me the amount of students that lived at home, in another home, or if they lived in both. When I imported pandas it gave my the ability to see the data more compressed and together. I then imported the data file I wanted to see into jupyter. I then printed the head of the set which is first 5 rows and 642 columns. I then printed the column names and chose which one I was using and descriptivly named it. Then the output was the frequencies of each specfic category in the column.
